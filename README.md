# 3.-Microcontroller-Capacitance-Meter

This is the third of a series of micro-controller based physics labs
The capacitance of a capacitor (or set of capacitors) is measured
by means of charging the capacitor to a preset voltage and measuring 
the time required.  Once charged, the capacitor is discharged -- first
through an LED and then directly to ground.  The LED is used to illustrate
the energy stored in the capacitor.  The cycle repeats indefinitely.
